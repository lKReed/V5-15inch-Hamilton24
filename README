HAMILTON ROBOTICS STYLE GUIDE:
  1. Use camelCase for variables and objects
  2. Use ExcitedCamelCase for global variables
  3. Comments!!!
  4. When pushing to github, messages must be helpful (ie no keyboard mashing)
     and should be followed by "-LR" (replacing "LR" with your own initials)
  5. If you are experimenting, please don't code in the main branch
  6. Don't push faulty code!
  7. Always pull before you make changes
  8. I know this is C++, follow the Zen of Python anyways!

ZEN OF PYTHON:
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
